-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--To create the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
--Next, I explored the data by answereing questions using the following SQL:

--What is the average danceability by artist? 
SELECT SUM(danceability)/(count(distinct artist_name)) avg
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
;

--What is the average danceability by track? 
SELECT SUM(danceability)/(count(distinct track_id)) avg
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
SELECT distinct artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;

--What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1
;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT avg(danceability) AS average_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE danceability in (SELECT danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10)   
;

--What's the average popularity for the 10 longest songs?
SELECT AVG(popularity) avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity IN (SELECT popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC LIMIT 10)
;

--What's the average popularity for the 10 shortest songs?
SELECT avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity in(SELECT popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY duration_ms asc LIMIT 10)
;

-- What is the name of the most popular song from Dua Lipa and what is the popularity score?
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE artist_name = 'Dua Lipa'
ORDER BY popularity desc limit 1
;

--Who is the most popular artist based on the sum of the popularity of their songs?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc limit 1
;
